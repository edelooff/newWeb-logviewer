# newWeb logviewer

This is an example application built on [newWeb](https://github.com/edelooff/newWeb) which can be used to view the SQLite log-files generated by uWeb.

# How to run

Simply running the `serve.py` script included at the repository root should suffice, assuming newWeb itself has been installed. Additionally, an Apache configuration and WSGI script are included, allowing for migration from `mod_python` (ÂµWeb) to `mod_wsgi` (newWeb).
